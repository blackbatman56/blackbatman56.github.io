    <center> <h1>Steps to Implement Communism:</h1> </center>
        <h2> Step One: Out of the oppression. - 
When a country gets free of any kind of oppression (such as: Dictatorship, Despotism, Royalism, Imperialism, etc.), it finds itself in a difficult economic position. At this point, it shall first adopt a Capitalist Regime, which will permit the country in question to gain an important economic power.</h2>
    <h2>Step Two: A superficial equalization - 

Our country is now economically developed, but inequalities in the population remain. At this point comes the stage of Social Democracy. It will permit the opressed to gain a higher priority in front of the government. Social Democracy subists until the country knows a perfect Superficial Equalization. </h2>
    <h2>Step Three: The Red Flag - 

The road has been cleaned to let Socialism get in the scene. Socialism will never last long if imposed by force or in a country in crisis.
Important: the notion of freedom must not disappear. </h2>
    <h2>Final Step: The Marxist dream - 

The country and the people are prepared to see the arrival of what is near utopia. A government that deprives you from nothing. A government that lets each of you live in freedom, mental health, with your goods, without being oppressed, and without oppressing others. Communism.
