    <h1><u>About the Purpose of this website</u></h1>
  </center>
    <p><h3> The point of this website is to show the steps we need to take in order to establish a form of communism within the United States of America.
      For too long have the rich gotten richer, and the poor stayed poor, leading to the lowest earning middle class in modern history.
      People before have tried, in the past, to tackle this issue, but to no avail. Their efforts are always shut down by those hungry for power, good-for-nothing
      pigs in Congress. </h3> </p>
